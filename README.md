# SearchEngine

Utilises an index to optimise the look up process. Each word can simply be checked as the key of a dictionary instead of searching through lines of text after reading each file.

## How to Use

+ Open your local terminal window & navigate to directory containing the search.py script.
+ Enter:
    `python3 search.py <relative_file_path_to_searchable_directory>`
